# StayAwake
I just made another solution for the lock screen problem in VBS. This script sends a NumLock key every 500 millisecond (0.5 second) to prevent the screen become switch into a lock screen mode. 
## How to run
You can generate the .exe file with Visual Studio, or run the .vbs script with wscript.exe what you can find on your windows, look for the path and run the cmd command below:
```
'wscript-path'\wscript.exe   'vbs-script-path'\Awake.vbs
```
(With this run method you do not get GUI)
